(The above link works, though there are some errors that will occur.)

```This is an app designed for mobile applications using a LAMP stack:
Laravel-artisan-mySQL-PHP

locally, run with the command: php artisan serve (runs on port 8000)

The purpose is to simplify the process of managing a long-term illness by keeping critical information in one place.```

Currently, the app can help with:

-tracking trends in blood glucose levels (by a list and by a graph)

-tracking prescriptions, so that they are all listed in one place

-tracking days remaining on each prescription for refill management

-list critical phone numbers when help is needed.

*Still to do:*

-fix error that stops app from working upon login (heroku deploy is successfull, but login connection is not)

-remove all tables and migrate them using php for best results

-get contact information to be dynamic.

`Longer term:`

-create buttons in 'contacts' that will call the selected number

-create links to the pharmacy that will renew presecriptions with a click
